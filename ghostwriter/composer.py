I hope this email finds you well. I have been following your recent work at the Allen School, particularly your contributions to {prof.get('title', 'computer science')}.

My experience with {templates[resume_key]} can specifically help your team with the technical challenges mentioned in your latest papers. I am particularly interested in how your research handles [Scraped Project Task/Bottleneck].

I've attached my resume (Resume {resume_key}) for your reference and would love to discuss potential opportunities in your lab.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
