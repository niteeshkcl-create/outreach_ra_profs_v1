# Matching Logic Skill

## Core Instruction
When drafting, if the professor is from eScience, reference their 'Special Interest Group'. If from the Allen School, find a technical bottleneck in their research. Use the phrase: "My experience with [Resume Skill] can specifically help your team with [Scraped Project Task]."

## Refinement Rules
- **Allen School**: Focus on technical/systems aspects.
- **eScience**: Focus on applied/interdisciplinary aspects.
- **Tone**: Professional yet enthusiastic.
- **Personalization**: Mention at least one specific project or paper from the scraped data.
- **Daily Limit**: Stop after drafting 15 emails.
- **De-duplication**: Check `data/sent_log.csv` before drafting.
